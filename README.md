# Event Reservation App

As a response to the necessity of a reservation platform for a company that provides photo booths, video booths, and other entertainment services, I have developed the Event Reservation App. Through this app, clients can reserve
a service or a package of services by creating an event for a specific date and time. Each user has an event; each event has a package; each package has products. The prices for products and packages are set up by the admin user
## Features

As a user, I can:
- view all products
- view all packages
- create a new event
- add package to event
- view a specific event


As an admin, I can:
- update event date
- delete event
- add link to event
- update package price'
- create package
- detele package
- create product
- update product price
- delete product
- create user
- add role to user
- delete user

## API Authentication and Authorization

There are only two requests which don't require authorization headers.

#### Authenticate (login)

```http
  POST /authenticate
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `body` | `json` | **Required**. The properties of user to authenticate  |

Request body example:

```json
{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```  

#### Register

```http
  POST /register
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `body` | `json` | **Required**. The properties of user to register  |

Request body example:

```json
{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string"
}

```  
After running the authenticate request, the client will obtain an access token that will be used in all subsequent request in order to authenticate the user and to authorize the user based on its role.

This is an example of what should be included in the request header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNjcxMTQzMzEyfQ.dxIzsD9Bm8y_kw3MOoZ2JXIKOg--uZaA5XNtBLdGYc4Ps3nlzBFDwBJi0bEeHlCggonZ6nQ2zwCI0D5a7dXjmw
```  
## Prerequisites

For building and running the application you need:
- JDK 1.8 or higher
- Maven 3

For building and running the application with Docker, you need:

- Docker Desktop (for Windows and Mac) or Docker Engine (for Linux)
- Docker Compose (optional, for orchestrating multi-container applications)


## Dependencies

You don't need any additional dependencies.
All dependecies related to database management, server management, security management and so on, will be automatically injected by Maven using the pom.xml file located in the root folder of the project.

## Installation

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ekeszler/EventReservation_app
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

## Run Locally

Use maven to build the app and, to run it, and to start the local embedded Tomcat server

```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
```


## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  mvn test
```


## Running Locally with Docker
### Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the root directory of your project where the Dockerfile is located, and run the following command:

```http
docker build -t event-reservation-app .
```

### Run the Application

```http
docker run -p 8080:8080 event-reservation-app
```
### Run using docker Compose (Optional)

If your application requires running multiple services (like an app server and a database), you can use Docker Compose to manage these services. Here is an example docker-compose.yml file for your application:

```http
docker-compose up
```

This command builds and starts both the application and the database containers. The application will connect to the MySQL database as configured in your application's properties.

## Deployment with Docker

Deploying your dockerized application can vary based on your hosting provider. Typically, you would push your Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry) and then pull and run it on your production server. Here are the basic steps for pushing to Docker Hub:

### Tag your image
```http
docker tag event-reservation-app yourusername/event-reservation-app:latest
```

### Push your image to the registry
```http
docker push yourusername/event-reservation-app:latest
```

After pushing your image, you can follow your hosting provider's instructions.


## Usage

You can use the demo version of the app, using SwaggerUI and following this link:

```javascript
https://willbeuploaded
```

First, obtain an access token by running the /authenticate endpoint with username "user" and password "pass", which will grant you admin rights in the application.

![App Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/VTQibfA_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand)

After that, authorize yourself by clicking the authorize button and copy-pasteing the token from the response.

![App Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/arTX2Ke_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand)

From now on, you can use all other available endpoints, as per swagger documentation.
## Roadmap

In the future, application can be extended with following:

- a review functionality - after use the companys services the user can write a review.

- an e-mail sending functionality -before and after the event, reminder e-mails will be sent to remind the customer that he/she will have an event at the established date and some days after the event another mail will be sent to remind that the user can leave a review
